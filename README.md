### Research 

My current research focuses on improving the understanding of how hyporheic zone processs interacts with dynamic hydrologic conditions and geomorphic processes and diverse sources of nutrients and quantifying the processes at multiple temporal and spatial scale. In particular, quantification of denitrifcation and respiration processes in the hyporheic zone is the first priority. Previous study have used field measurement and mechanistic modeling approach to quantify the role of hyporheic zone process in terms of stream and groundwater flow and their quality. However, the scale of their study is often limited to reach scale and low order streams. In my study, we use a process-based modeling appraoch to quantify the basin scale hyporheic zone process and the study site is the whole columiba river basin.

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/kkyong77/profile/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
